# Overview

This application is a demonstation of the skills I have aquired in the Java language.

This software is a basic to-do list application that allows you to create, delete, and update tasks. These tasks are consistently auto-saved to a JSON file that is loaded upon each open of the application. 
This application was written for me to learn about Java development and strengthen my understanding of JSON reading and writing.
